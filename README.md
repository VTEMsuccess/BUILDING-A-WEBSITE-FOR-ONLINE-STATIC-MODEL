# BUILDING-A-WEBSITE-FOR-ONLINE-STATIC-MODEL
ABSTRACT

Context: In today's booming era of information technology, e-commerce has 
established itself as an indispensable trend in modern business. Particularly, in specialized 
sectors like the static model industry, there is a growing demand for effective online 
solutions that combine convenience and enhanced user experience. With the aim of 
improving management efficiency and business operations, this study focuses on 
developing a dedicated website to support the sale of static model products.

Objective: The research aims to build a modern online sales platform with features 
tailored to improve management and customer care. The website is designed with a userfriendly and intuitive interface. It caters to two main user groups: customers (including 
guest users and registered members with accounts) and administrators. Customers can 
carry out key activities such as browsing products, searching for items, reviewing products, 
making payments, and viewing order history. Administrators play a crucial role in 
managing core functions such as product management, order management, customer 
management, and generating reports. Additionally, the website includes a live chat feature 
for direct interaction with administrators, enabling users to receive prompt responses to 
their queries.

Method: The website is built using core web development technologies, including 
HTML, CSS, JavaScript, MySQL, and PHP. To optimize the interface, libraries and 
frameworks like Bootstrap and TailwindCSS are utilized. MySQL is selected as the 
database management system for storing and managing information. The PHPMailer 
library is used for automated email sending via the SMTP protocol, facilitating flexible 
user interaction.

Result: The project successfully developed core website functionalities, including 
product and customer management and email verification for password recovery. Nonfunctional requirements, such as password encryption and user notifications, were also 
implemented successfully. Using CSS frameworks, the interface was designed to be 
modern, user-friendly, and intuitive. The MySQL database ensures secure, stable, and 
efficient data management.

Conclusion: Based on the achieved results, the development of the "building a website 
for online static model" not only makes shopping more seamless, efficient, and engaging 
for users but also provides a comprehensive solution for customer interaction. This project 
is considered a potential tool with scalability, contributing to enhanced business efficiency 
in the rapidly evolving e-commerce landscape
